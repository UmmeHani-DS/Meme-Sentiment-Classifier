# Meme Classifier Using Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

The Meme Classifier project leverages machine learning techniques to classify memes based on their textual content and visual features. Memes, a significant part of internet culture, convey humor, satire, or social commentary in a concise and visually appealing format. With the vast volume of memes online, automating their classification aids in content moderation, trend analysis, and understanding user engagement.

## Objective

The primary objective of the Meme Classifier project is to develop a robust system that categorizes memes into sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) based on their textual and visual features. The project integrates techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction from images, and supervised learning algorithms.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset of memes, including both textual content and corresponding images.

2. **Textual Data Preprocessing:**
   - Convert text to lowercase, remove special characters, and eliminate stop words.

3. **Image Data Preprocessing:**
   - Resize images and extract visual features using techniques like the Canny edge detector.

### Feature Extraction

1. **Textual Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract features from meme captions using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, converting textual data into numerical feature vectors.

2. **Visual Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract visual features from images using the Canny edge detector, converting them into numerical arrays.

### Model Training and Evaluation

1. **Model Training:**
   - Utilize machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors for classification.

2. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Assess models using evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

### Model Integration and Ensemble Learning

- Employ ensemble learning techniques like the Voting Classifier to combine predictions from multiple models, enhancing classification accuracy and robustness.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, TextBlob, OpenCV, Scikit-image, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- **Model Serialization:** Pickle

## Conclusion

The Meme Classifier project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to categorize memes based on textual and visual characteristics. By leveraging both feature types, the classifier enhances accuracy and provides valuable insights into the sentiment and content of online memes, addressing the challenges of analyzing multimedia content in the digital age.
